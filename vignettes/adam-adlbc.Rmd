The ADLBC dataset code can be found [here](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/blob/main/submission/programs/adlbc.r) - 

## Specification File

```{r, echo = FALSE}
adlbc_spec <- read_xlsx("../submission/adam/ADaM - Pilot 3.xlsx", sheet = 3) %>%
  filter(Dataset == "ADLBC")
dataset_vignette(adlbc_spec)
```

## Dataset

```{r, echo = FALSE}
adlbc <- read_xpt("../submission/adam/adlbc.xpt")
dataset_vignette(adlbc_spec)
```

## QC Findings and Et Cetera

The original ADLBC was done in SAS and a quick QC was done.  The code for the comparison between the R and SAS generated datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/blob/main/submission/programs/qc_adlbc.r)
