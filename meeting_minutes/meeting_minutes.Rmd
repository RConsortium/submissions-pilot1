#### Pilot 3 Progress Update :
All 5 ADaMs now generated and in review. 

Per development steps, we have noted discrepancies or findings when comparing our Pilot 3 ADaMs with the original Pilot 1 ADaMs. You may see these noted in our Wiki here : https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/wiki/QC-Findings .

Minor updates are being made to clean up code, updating our variable labels appropriately and updating the ADaM specifications (define) to meet CDISC guidance as we go through our routine P21 checks. 

We are also currently developing our ADRG based off of the Pilot 3 specifications we are reading into P21.  We plan to use the P21 ADRG as a base, then we will add in information similar to that of Pilot 1 for complete instructions prior to submission.

As we finalize both the define and the ADaMs, we are also developing a batch run code to run all of our ADaM and TLF scripts, with that we are looking into implementing dependency recognition using a package called {targets} (e.g. before ADAE is run, checks latest ADSL code has been run first).  

Additionally, we are rerunning all TFL scripts from Pilot 1 and re-sourcing the Pilot 3 data.

Once the above is finalized, we will do a batch run, check against P21, then bring everything over into our eSubmission repo. We have made contact with Roche's Regulatory function who will help support the preparation of our eSubmission in eCTD structure.

#### Current Project workflow discussion as seen in Pilot 1 :
Upon reviewing Pilot1's work and the R4CSR guidance they have followed, we see the current flow suggests the use of 2 repos : 1)Project repo & 2)Submission repo

In the project repo, this includes the project analysis R scripts (ADaMs and TFLs) and R utility functions within the same package.

```r
14.2.2 programs

Folder path: ectddemo/m5/datasets/ectddemo/analysis/adam/programs/.

r0pkgs.txt: contains all internally developed proprietary R packages.
Other .txt files: each contains R code for a specific analysis.
```

They also suggest using .RMD files as the source analysis scripts, which are then converted to .R/.txt for submission.

Then all .txt are brought over to the Submission repo to deliver to Regulatory for eCTD structure and formal submission to the FDA portal.

In Pilot 3 our project flow emulates more of the usual project work we would see in our companies.

For instance, our source code will just use plain .R instead of .RMD as source analysis code.  Especially for ADaMs, it make more sense to just start in .R scripts.

For the most part Pilot3 will follow the same submission process as Pilot1, but the minor difference will just be our project flow. I.E., Pilot 3 will seperate the Utility functions from the Project analysis scripts into different repos.  It makes more sense to treat the study specific utility functions as seperate package, similar to how we call on other R packages from CRAN or other git repositories, where then the project analysis repo scripts will call on the aformentioned study specific utility functions package.  This is still in line with the R4CSR guidance in section 14.3  

Following this approach, makes it clear from a study perspective where the utility functions are being called from, where the project analysis scripts are stored and developed and where the submission will be.  For illustration purposes we have this graphic (Thanks, Thomas Neitman!) : 

![](images/pilot3_3repos.PNG)

Overall, to our Health Agencies, the single source of truth will of course come from our 'Submission' repo, where they may not need all of the details of the study project flow steps.  We just wanted to be able to discern that R packages should be kept in their own packages and project analysis work should not be stored as a package.

Best,
Thomas and Joel

#### POST Meeting notes/actions from R Consortium Submissions WG (07Apr2023) : 
  -Per Paul Shuette, Pilot 3 needs a link to the 'FREE' P21 version that the Pilot 3 team should be using.  Paul to share link with Joel.
  -We should also include SDTM in the P21 run, but just mention in the ADRG that we will not be updating or fixing the SDTMs due to any P21 issues to follow the same approach as Pilot 1. Though Pilot 3 is mainly focused on ADaMs, we do plan on fixing the P21 issues the best we can and noting discrepancies compared to the CDISCPILOT data.
  -Need new repo from submission_wg to store the utility functions into. Joe R, could you help us with this?
  -For the study project repo set-up, there are example template repos that can be followed. Pilot 3 team to look into this.
  -Targeting mid-June 2023 to wrap-up submission.
Link to all Pilot 3 members, for Eric to include in Submission WG webpage : https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot3-adam/main/

Update : 
New repo for Proprietary R Package : https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-utilities

1. 
-   {admiral} v0.10 (or maybe even update CRAN snapshot and update all packages we are using.)

## ACTION : Decision to update admiral - adadas locf derivation now available. We need to update renv.lock then do renv::restore(). 
### Is everyone ok with updating CRAN snapshot and all packages? See https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/77#issuecomment-1476000593 and input your comments/responses. 

2. 
-   Pinnacle 21 report 

## ACTION : Check on ADTTE & ADLBC derivation specs : Bingjun and Nicole 
  
  - All other dataset specs OK, per Declan (ADSL), Kaz (ADADAS), ADAE (Phani/Joel)
  
## ACTION : I've created git issues for all datasets, please close issue in git to formally track that the specs are ok now.

  - This is the most up-to-date specs, where the define has 0 issues in Pinnacle 21 now.

    - Please use your gmail account to open this link. Direct message me in slack your gmail so that I can share the doc.
  
3. 
- Joel to continue to resolve ADADAS.AVAL length, will reach out to Kaz if
    needed.
    - working on branch 10 to update this before PR.

### Update : length now fixed and P21 issue now resolved.

4. 
- ADRG needs to be worked on. How best to collaborate 
  - Decision - we will continue with google docs. Since this is an open source pilot study, there is nothing too confidential to worry about.  Feel free to create temporary google accounts if you don't have one, then share your gmail with me so that I can share google docs with you.  [Thanks Ben and Declan for sharing your accounts with me.  I've added you to the google doc list where you should be able to now access the meeting recordings (or at least request access) and the google docs.]

## ACTION : To update ADRG, we can 
#### 1) copy text from Pilot 1 to Pilot 3 adrg. Pilot 1 adrg : <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda/blob/main/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot1/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf>, 
#### 2) Take Pilot 3 proposal : <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/blob/main/vignettes/fda/R_Submission_Pilot_3_ADaM_FDA_Execution_Proposal_02Dec2022.pdf> and include this info into the Pilot 3 ADRG (should list out all steps for FDA to unpack the Pilot 3 project.) 
#### 3) This is the current base ADRG directly coming from P21 : https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xMUVQgZMmXd1igdZNUQy1Pc-WxoMxL7/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=103991081896680964420&rtpof=true&sd=true We then just need to mash all of this information into one cohesive Reviewer's guide that is specific to Pilot 3.  
#### One recommednation would be to just copy Pilot 1's ADRG and update it with the Pilot 3 proposal/project unpacking steps and information.

5. 
- Once above is up to date, we need to move over programs to esub repo, then Robert Devine can unpack and test.
    
#### Announcements : 
- Thomas leaving Roche to pursue new position. Congrats to Thomas! You will be missed at Roche, but glad to know you'll still be Co-Leading/Collaborating with us in this open source Pilot 3 project.

-   Joel has made updates to specs to help resolve our P21 issues. Only
    looking at the define alone, there are currently 300+ issues, which
    should be resolvable as we remove all reference to datasets,
    codelists, variables from datasets that we are not generating in
    Pilot 3.

![](images/pilot3_meeting_minutes_define.PNG)

### ACTION to Lei Zhao : Thanks to the discussion within the team, we should be able to resolve the issues directly in P21. Then Lei will : <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/61>

##### 1)Update define directly in P21 to resolve issues with the specs.

##### 2)Generate define.xml to validate against the ADaM .xpts

##### 3)re-export the updated Excel sheet so team can rerun their ADaM scripts against the new specs to make sure metatools and xportr functions are calling in the specs appropriately.

-   Robert working on KM plot to PR today.

#### ACTION to Robert : call on {Pilot3} package for utility functions, path to the ADaMs generated in our Pilot, output filename with `-pilot3` extension.

-   Bingun updated demog table and is in PR already.

### ACTION to Joel : Review PRs and merge accordingly.

-   Steven updated script for adtte.R to call on {Pilot3} and path to
    the ADaMs generated in our Pilot.

We are almost there!

-   Next meeting go through a process flow of data, TLFs in a project
    area going into eSUB.
-   P21 issues shared by Lei and now listed for all to review and
    resolve in issue #61

### ACTION : All please confirm the P21 issues are now resolved in #61.

Joel - Started meeting.

Ben Straub - Pilot 3 website now up and running. Need updates to authors
in DESCRIPTION file to those in Pilot 3. Follow Pilot 1 and do Vignettes
for datasets, in Pilot 3, still on the table and could be valuable to
public viewers of the Pilot 3 repo for convenient viewing of our work.
Can help advocate R use.

-   ADAE in PR.

### ACTION : message from Thomas to review this : <https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/C04968ES7T4/p1675170902021159> need to check. Also need to implement solution for TRTEMFL discrepancy solution #38

-   since we are matching with the original ADAE, if we update this we
    need to see if it creates discprenancies and need to document in our
    QC findings.

2.  Kanjie

-   Populated Value level metadata tab has been updated for ADAS
-   Need to focus on quality of define

3.  Nicole

-   Reviewed Thomas's comments on ADLBC and addressed them.
-   still have 30+ discrepant records particular to end of treatment.
    Endpoint variables are missing for those 30 values. In progress at
    this time.
-   qa_adlbc.R created and all match except for those 30 records.
-   attribute discrepancies will need to check hours vs date. see how it
    impacts table program. if no impact we can document differences in
    QC findings wiki.

4.  Declan

-   No updates

5.  Dadong

-   Will move on to tables/graph tasks.

6.  AOB

-   Where to find table and graph programs.

### ACTION for those that can work on updating the output programs, they can be found here :

    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/tree/main/vignettes> Each of the .RMD scripts that start with `tlf-*` can be used to update and read our Pilot 3 datasets. Then pick either #29 , #31 , #32.

## 13Jan2023 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

1.  Declan

-   ADSL QC, SAS and R differences. Issue seems to be with original ADSL
    not Pilot 3 ADSL. What is approach to fix?
    -   Thomas suggests differences like this we need to document to
        note the updates we had to make to follow the documented define.
    -   Joel mentions that there is this tab which we can use to
        document differences and update the specs with the corrected
        approach.
        <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gLm_IITesD8jUoygJ3rRQmLj1Wmt5P4NrteDogTWaI4/edit#gid=1009681230&range=F1>
    -   LB.VISIT incorrectly set as derivation not in ADLBC.

### ACTION to Declan - Create a seperate document to note differences.

### ACTION to Joel : remove datasets in define that we will not be submitting in Pilot 3.

### ACTION to Steven : double check if there were issues in codelists.

### ACTION to Nicole : also found issues in specs in ADLBC, work with Stephen to update ADLBC specs appropriately.

2.  Ben

4.  Steven

-   Reviewing Pilot 3 proposal to the FDA and proposed an alternate
    approach to submission. Issue #37.
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/37#issuecomment-1347960472>

### ACTION : Steven to share proposal in a seperate meeting or we prolong our standup to an hour to continue further discussion on this.

5.  Kanjie

-   Rerun primary table as used with ADADAS, made updates to table
    script only due to updated R version and package versions, nothing
    else. Upon generation, due to discrepancies found in ADADAS with the
    original dataset, the results show minor differences.

### ACTION :Kaz to document these differences in a doc. Same doc where ADSL differences are captured.

-   ADSL codelist can use metatool functions rather than writing
    separate code for formatting per specs. Kaz created an issue #45
-   ADAE TRTEMFL discrepancy solution #38

### ACTION : Phani and Joel to update ADAE FLP with Kaz's suggestions.

### ACTION : PR ADAE and ADLBC to main as draft so that others can see the scripts for these.

6.  Bingjun

-   ADTTE specs seem to be missing in define.

## 06Jan2023 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

Happy New Year and Welcome back!

1.  Joel L.

-   FLP ADAE majority completed by Phani (Great work, Phani!).
-   Going through Pilot 3 proposal review, new comments have come in
    which are being addressed.
    -   Question from Ben - how will the R package work when submitted
        to the FDA via eCTD?
    -   Answer - The package will essentially be an R package of the
        project, including all of the R package utility functions we
        used in pilot 3 (as listed in the renv.lock file) and all of the
        project work scripts that generate the ADaMs and Tables/Graph.
        Alternatively, instead of a package a simple .txt file for all
        of the packages used and another .txt file for all ADaM and
        Tables/Graph script can simply be delivered as well with
        instruction for either approach written appropriately in the
        ADRG. Goal of this pilot is for FDA to be able to receive R
        submissions in Clinical Trial work that is understandable to
        unpackage, readable and/or executable.

2.  Ben S.

-   Github actions
    -   check everyone's codes in that the code runs on Windows, Mac,
        Linux
    -   PR done and needs to get merged. Joel to merge.
    -   Package down - new issue #42 to update all Pilot 1 info to
        Pilot 3. Create website.

3.  Declan

-   ADSL updated and merged to main, but need to double check if been
    compared to original ADSL. He'll follow-up.

4.  Lei

-   Check that we're using the correct define. Issue #10.
    -   needs github access
    -   work on ADRG

5.  Kanjie

-   ADADS merged to main, but when compared to original ADADS
    discrepancies came up.
    -   Admiral recent released derive_locf_records(), limited to only
        AVAL variable as last observed record carried over, but does not
        include other variables needed. Kaz made updates to function
        herself to fix issue on her end. Working with admiral to update
        in next release. At this time has saved function in function
        folder in pilot 3 repo. See #50
    -   Second issue noted in #39 with original ADADS.

6.  Phani

-   updating labels in ADAE. Derivation of all variables are complete.
-   issue with TRTEMFL derivation issue #38
-   will work with Joel to get scripts pushed to git

7.  AOB

-   Need to follow up on ADLBC.
-   Tables working group meetings vs submission working group meetings
-   Review that our work in Pilot 3 is creating ADaMs originally used in
    Pilot 1 to generate Tables/Graphs, then take the Pilot 1 Table/Graph
    scripts and source our ADaMs to generate the Tables/Graphs.

Meeting adjourned.


## 23Dec2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

Meeting cancelled, because it's time to take a break and hang out with
our Families and Friends. Have a well-deserved and relaxing break
everyone. We'll pick it up again next year! \~Thomas and Joel

![](images/eoy_meme.jpg)

## 19Dec2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

1.  Ben S. - brought up package down sites for Pilot 3. Easy to do from
    Posit.

### ACTION to Ben S. - work on Pilot 3 package down site. Update to show our progress on Pilot 3 ADaM. <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/>

### <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/11>

2.  Kanjie - ADAS almost done. Working on one more parameter
    discrepancy. Working using new functionality in `admiral{} 0.9.0`
    per updated `renv.lock`.

### ACTION to Kanjie - work on table : <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/30> compare against Pilot 1.

### googlespreadsheet define working well so far. Updating the descriptions correctly so that the `metacore{}` package can import well. Able to import excel directly. At some point we'll need to update the Value Level metadata.

3.  Joel - still working on ADAE. Phani has worked on half of ADAE and
    still needs to derive 13 more variables. I took time to meet with
    Phani set up his Posit Cloud and github connection, so he was able
    to push his script up to git, where then I can pull his work to
    continue updates. Delivered Pilot 3 proposal to R Consortium for
    review :
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/37>

4.  Some notes for everyone on Pilot 3. As we are all trying to work in
    the same environment on Posit or on your local computer, before
    making any pushes or PRs, please make sure you're not changing any
    of our environment files (e.g. `renv.lock`) in your branch, then
    pushing up and accidentally merging to main (though we do have the
    `main` branch protected, we're only human and something could get
    through). As users pull from main and merge to their dev branches to
    get the udpates, any change in the environment when doing a restore
    could show errors in their program due to different package
    versions. Pay attention to detail and mindful of the changes being
    made in your PRs. Thanks everyone for your cooperation!

### SEE YOU ALL NEXT YEAR.

### ACTION to Joel - Create deadlines on `main` Read.me file so that everyone has transparency on work that needs to be done at a certain time. Maybe create a Kanban board on the issues.

## 09Dec2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

1.  Joel

-   getting updated define.xml and converting to google spreadsheet,
    editable by everyone. Notes on the versioning, since Pilot 3 is
    based off of Pilot 1 it makes sense to use the define from Pilot 1
    to continue using in Pilot 3. The CDISCPILOT define seems to have
    had a lot of issues in P21, but the Pilot 1 define only had 8 issues
    per P21 v5.2.
    a.  Current define spreadsheet here for team members to edit as
        needed :
        <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/10#issuecomment-1342005671>
-   New issues created for Tables and Graphs. Please assign yourself to
    work on these and test the Pilot 3 ADaMs as source data in these
    output programs to see if they match the Pilot 1 outputs.

2.  Kanjie

-   `metacore{}` issue, not able to read in define.xml if there is a
    metadata label empty in the specs, but the `metacore{}`
    author/developers have worked on a fix for this to allow empty
    labels. With this update, there could be a new version of
    `metacore{}`.
-   Continuing updates to ADAS specs in the new spreadsheet as needed.

### ACTION to Kanjie : update `renv.lock` in `main` branch to the `metacore{}` version we need to have aformentioned udpate. Then all Pilot 3 users can run these steps <https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/C04968ES7T4/p1671196678615089> to update their branches, including `renv::restore()` to get the udpated metacore package.

3.  Dadong

-   working on ADLB with Nicole. Current environment is on his working
    computer, but will plan to transition to Posit Cloud so that he will
    be using the same environment as the rest of the team.

### ACTION to Thomas : Current Posit Cloud is now using R 4.2.2, where there is a check in `startup` that notes we should be using 4.2.1. But this should not be the case. Thomas will create an issue to remove the R version check so that we all just use the most current version in Posit Cloud. Current issue :

    R version change [4.2.1 -> 4.2.2] detected when restoring session; search path not restored
    Connected to your session in progress, last started 2022-Dec-23 20:09:44 UTC (14 minutes ago)

4.  Thomas

-   Final comments on ADSL pull request. Declan will be taking on these
    updates and will be the first progam and dataset to be merged to
    main branch.
-   ADAS may soon be merged before the holiday by Kanjie.

5.  Ben S.

-   released a new version of Admiral 0.9.0 and should update
    `renv.lock` file.\
    -Thomas mentioned we already proposed a CRAN snapshot from the 1st
    of November, but with the udpate needed for both `metacore{}` and
    `admiral{}`, we need to be clear in our final documents what CRAN
    snapshot we will be using.

### ACTION/Request to Ben S. : Can we get `renv.lock` updated to also read in new Admiral version?

6.  Declan

-   working on ADSL PR. Working with Steven and Thomas, ADSL should be
    in merged to main soon.

7.  Robert

-   working on ADTTE. Has derived ADTTE with the ADAE dependency from
    the CDISCPilot/Pilot 1 ADaM datasets, not purely deriving from SDTM.
    May have a draft of this ADTTE in a week or so. Once ADAE is ready
    in Pilot 3, then ADTTE should source the Pilot 3 ADAE in the final
    run.\
-   Note about testing. Working in 'Windows' vs 'Posit Cloud'. Once FDA
    receives Pilot 3 package, they may be running in Windows and not
    using Posit Cloud, like us.
-   Confirms that he uses `.R` suffix vs `.r`
-   has also removed the `ad_` prefix in program filename as readable
    code would normally not have this prefix.
-   Found a Merck document that describes the udpates to the define.
    Could be helpful for traceability.

### ACTION/Request to Robert : Can you share the Merck document describing the updates to the define and post it here : <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/10> ? Maybe even get the define.xml for to push to our Pilot 3 repo.

### ACTION/Request to Ben S. : At the end of our pilot 3, we need to test that our package runs fine on a regular Windows environment, not Posit. As most likely our stakeholders will just be running on their local computers.

8.  Phani

-   Progress on ADAE, date variables updated, still working on 13 more
    variables. Still working on his local machine and will need help
    with setting up Posit and Git.

9.  Lei

-   Will help with issue #10.

10. Bingjun (Ben)

-   Working on ADTTE, using `admiral{}`, not `dplyr{}`.

11. AOB :

-   FOLLOW-UP question from Steven H. :
    `The derivation of all highlighted variables can not be ADLB.XXX = LB.VISITNUM, especially not variables that are taken from demographics like AGE.`
    -   Joel Response : It seems the erroneoulsy documented derivations
        for these variables are not the datasets we are working with in
        Pilot 3. For now, we can ignore these if they do not impact the
        datasets we are working on. I tried to create an issue in the
        TDF repo, but 'issues' weren't accessible to me. Feel free to
        add an issue if you have access :

### HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL TAKING EARLY BREAK FOR THE EOY! WILL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR.

## 02Dec2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

Just as a quick update to today's catch-up meeting (apologies, I forgot
to record this meeting as well).

1.  Our current focus (the meat of the project) is just to continue
    working on ADaM programming. The organization and final areas where
    all of our documents, programs, directory packages will go can be
    decided at a later time. To help set priorities, my suggestion would
    be :
    a.  Posit Cloud and github setup. Make sure we're all working in the
        same environment.
    b.  First line programming of ADaMs (e.g. define updates, checks
        against the CDISC pilot ADaMs using {diffdf} )
    c.  Once we {diffdf} checks pass, then run these source datasets
        into Pilot 1 programs.
        i.  Please study and reference this doc :
            <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda/blob/main/m1/us/report-tlf.pdf>
        ii. Since we forked the Pilot 1 repo, we should be able to get
            Pilot 1 programs from here :
            <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/tree/main/vignettes>
        iii. Update Pilot 1 programs to make sure they work in our
             current environment (e.g. R v4.2.1, any package updates
             needed due to different R version we are using), per
             <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/6>
2.  Will need to work with @Phani Tata github set-up off-line to save
    versions of his development. Thanks, Phani for continuing with the
    ADAE program development.
3.  We need define udpates per @Kangjie Zhang request. A proposal has
    been made here if anyone can help with this :
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/10#issuecomment-1335565702>
4.  @Bingjun Wang working on ADRG. You may use content in this proposal
    for ADRG. See :
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/28#issuecomment-1335528257>
5.  @Nicole Jones has updated Pilot 3 main repo info. Thank you! Now
    continuing on with ADLBC with @Dadong Zhang .
6.  ADSL updates are underway as I see communication here :
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/pull/27>
7.  ADTTE also upon finalization :
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/pull/21> .

For all working on the datasets, recall the approach is to use the the
Pharmaverse packages, i.e., {admiral} package.

Announcement : Proposal for Pilot 3 FDA execution will be delivered to
the rest of the R Consortium team soon. If you'd like to take a read
updated proposal is here, for now, and will soon be in the RConsortium
submissionswg repo .

Let @Thomas Neitmann or I know if you have any further questions.

## 28Nov2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

Unfortunately we didn't record last week's stand up. But given the
holidays in the US it was a very short meeting anyways with only 4
attendees. I think the most important decision we made was to write all
ADaM scripts as plain .R files and not .Rmd files. Please use
admiral/pharmaverse function if available and only rely on
dplyr/tidyverse as a fallback option. Also, please open a pull request
as soon as you have a draft program available. That way the progress on
your programs is transparent for all team members. Just follow what
@Kangjie Zhang did.

## 14Nov2022 - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

Thanks, @channel for those able to join today's Pilot 3 weekly catch-up
meeting. Just to bullet :

1.  Welcome @Declan Hodges to the team! Great to have more participation
    in this pilot. Currently, Declan is working to get his environment
    set-up on his end to begin work. Any current issues open in the
    repo, please feel free to assign yourself, Declan.

2.  Overall, it seems all others have been able to set up an instance of
    the working environment on R Studio Cloud just fine and all ADaMs
    seem to be in good progress.

3.  An issue came up regarding the define.xml , which doesn't seem to
    correspond very well with the define.pdf for. We've scoured the
    CDISC Pilot repo to see if there were any newer updates of the .xml
    file, but have not found one. Action to @Lei Zhao :

    a.  We could reach out to someone from the CDISC pilot team (maybe
        add an issue in their repo) to find out if we can get an updated
        define.xml.
    b.  Alternatively, if there is an .xls out there matching the
        define.pdf , we could use that .xls to read into to P21, then
        re-export a define.xml that way. -@Dadong Zhang @Kangjie Zhang,
        please feel free to chime in further on this topic to elaborate
        on the issues that you are seeing. -Re :
        <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam/issues/10>

4.  Discussion about workflow. For those new to github, it may help to
    have a small video tutorial on how to collaborate through git. Two
    approaches discussed :

    a.  For each dataset a branch has been created. If there are 2+
        contributors to a branch, they can continue working in the same
        branch, but just requires clear communication on when updated
        are pushed and when other contributors can pull to get those
        updates to continue working further until completion until final
        script is ready to merge back to main.
    b.  For each dataset a branch has been created. Additionally, for
        each contributor, they should also make their own branch for
        their own development/updates to the script, then PR to dataset
        branch to get the updates, resolve conflicts, and merge to
        completion, until final script is ready to merge back to main.

## 02Nov2022 : R Submission Pilot 3 - ADaM Kick-off - Minutes by Joel Laxamana

-   Team Roster:
    <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BW9Jojo4bAgxbfM96nXooh2QAlU6CKwk19pInxmI2VA/edit?usp=sharing>

-   GitHub repo:
    <https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam>

-   We added SDTM from from CDISC Pilot Project to the Pilot 3 repo so
    that our R ADaM programs can source these domains.

-   We also added ADaMs from the CDISC Pilot Project for ADaM developers
    can {diffdf} on.

-   {admiral} set-up demos :

-   If you already created a branch for a dataset to work on then you
    can get current updates by running the following commands in the
    RStudio terminal:

<!-- -->

    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout <your_branch>
    git merge --no-edit main
