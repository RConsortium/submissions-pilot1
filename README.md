## Overview

The objectives of the **R Consortium R Submission Pilot 3** Project are:  

1. Expand on the work done in [Submission Pilot 1](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot1/), by now utilizing R to generate ADaM datasets.
1. Deliver a R-based Submission through the [eTCD portal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/electronic-regulatory-submission-and-review/electronic-common-technical-document-ectd) with TLFs and ADaMs generated in R as well as a R-specific ADRG.

**NOTE:** This is a FDA-industry collaboration through the non-profit organization [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).


## What's on this Website?

This website encapsulates the hard-work of some intrepid statistical programmers from across the Pharma Industry
to demonstrate an R-based Submission.  The website is divide into 4 sections that will walk 
you through our efforts:

1. **Project Background/Setup** - Scope of Work, what we used and how we used it.
1. **Deliverables** - What was sent to the FDA - Cover Letter, TLFs, Datasets, ADRG.
1. **Conferences** - Proceedings from different conferences on Pilot Submissions
1. **FDA Feedback** - Specific feedback from FDA on this Submission
